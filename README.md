## 🔭 Projects

### 🌐 [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) Implementation](https://github.com/Arqamz/IPFS-Implementation)
Developed a robust data structures project in C++ simulating an InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) using a Ring Distributed Hash Table (DHT) based on the Chord protocol for efficient distributed file storage and retrieval. This scalable and fault-tolerant system handles data insertion, search, and deletion with dynamic node addition and removal.

### 🕹️ [Multithreaded Pacman](https://github.com/Arqamz/MultithreadedPacman)
Implemented a multi-threaded Pac-Man game in SFML C++ with advanced synchronization techniques using mutexes and semaphores, achieving smooth, concurrent gameplay.

### 🏋️ [Flex Trainer](https://github.com/Arqamz/FlexTrainerManagement)
Developed a C# desktop application with SQL Server for gym management, automating member management and training sessions. This project includes comprehensive audit logging for user activity tracking.

### 💬 [ChatVista](https://github.com/Arqamz/ChatVista)
Developed an inter-client, terminal-based chat application using C, facilitating communication between multiple clients with features like group chats and secure message handling. Leveraged processes like fork, exec, pipes, and shared memory for efficient inter-client communication.
